A mobile application to make dyslexics capable to travel effectively around cities, mitigating common reading errors. *From an idea of Martina Battan and Massimiliano Bernab√©.*

## At a glance

### What is the proposed application going to do?

* The primary objective is to help dyslexic to travel effectively around cities.
* The secondary objective is to raise awareness of the community on the dyslexia reading disorder.

### Input and output data

The application will use open mobility information in the format of the General Transit Feed Specification (GTFS). In particular will use at least the following:
 
|**agency**         | One or more transit agencies that provide the data in this feed.                                 |
|**stops**          | Individual locations where vehicles pick up or drop off passengers.                              |
|**routes**         | Transit routes. A route is a group of trips that are displayed to riders as a single service.    |
|**trips**          | Trips for each route. A trip is a sequence of two or more stops that occurs at specific time.    |
|**stop_times**     | Times that a vehicle arrives at and departs from individual stops for each trip.                 |
|**calendar**       | Dates for service IDs using a weekly schedule.                                                   |
|**calendar_dates** | Exceptions for the service IDs                                                                   |
|**shapes**         | *Optional* Rules for drawing lines on a map to represent a transit organization's routes.        |

From the [GTFS reference](https://developers.google.com/transit/gtfs/reference/)

The output will be a map service of public access presenting travelling informations accessible ready for a dyslexic user. Moreover the city4dys application will enhance the usability of those data adding some specific functionalities.

### Advantages of this application

* Advantages for the city
    * The adopting city can expose the "city4dys" logo near information maps to make dyslexic feel more comfortable while travelling around the city.
    * Not the application nor the city4dys platform will be used to promote private products through advertisements.
    * On the contrary there will be the possibility for the city to post messages about the travelling service or to inform the users about special events.
* Advantages for the user which is dyslexic  
    * Despite many applications where developed specifically for dyslexics, only one of them is spatially enabled, which is "OpenStreetMap for the dyslexic" made by the same people presenting here this project.
    * At the city level there is no such application, making travelling quite cumbersome for a dyslexic person.

## Some applications for dyslexics, with our comments

### OpenStreetMap for the dyslexic

From [osm4dys](http://www.osm4dys.org/)

We made this application which is the first mobile GIS application accessible ready for a dyslexic user. The application is completed and free. Can be founded on Google play at
https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.osm4dys.app

We have feedback on the application and we will enhance the city4dys application accordingly to this:

* add GPS positioning
* boost application performance for panning and zooming
* promote roads instead of building in the map
* a more dynamic text2speech
* a longer location history

### OSM Direction tool for Visually Impaired

From [OpenStreetMap](http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/OSM_Direction_tool_for_Visually_Impaired)

The application is a Keyboard accessible Directions tool using OpenSteetMap for Visually Impaired people. It works on the principle such that, 
after user enters source and destination as his/her query in text boxes, the route or walking/driving directions are resulted as output not only on maps but also as detailed text explaining entire route.

### Look and Listen Map

From [OpenStreetMap](http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/OSM_for_the_blind)

"Look and Listen Map" is an online map and routing service for blind, visually impaired and sighted persons based on OSM data. This application will use a Braille display as output device and/or voice that reproduce the text on the screen.

### HaptoRender

From [OpenStreetMap](http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/HaptoRender)

HaptoRender is planned to be a renderer that uses OSM data to create tactile maps for blind and visually impaired persons. HaptoRender will have several advantages compared with commercial tactile maps:
Phisical maps are cheaper, because there will not be any license cost for the map data.
If one part of a map is obsolete, the part can be reproduced.

### Read&Write (Commercial)

From [texthelp](http://www.texthelp.com/UK)

Read&Write is an easy-to-use flexible toolbar containing support features to make reading, writing and research easier for the dyslexic. The software has been designed to address some of the issues that people with dyslexia face daily, 
namely reading difficulties, writing difficulties, problems with spelling and general literacy support, but does not work on images.

### BrowseAloud (Commercial)

From [BrowseAloud](http://www.browsealoud.com/uk/)

BrowseAloud adds speech, reading and translation support to a website facilitating access and participation for those people with print disabilities, dyslexia, low literacy and mild visual impairments.


## Dyslexia in Europe

From [European Dyslexia Association](http://www.eda-info.eu)

According to substantiated scientific estimates, the group of European Citizens with dyslexia and specific learning differences encompasses between 5 and 12 percent of the population,navigating through life in a largely non-'dys' friendly world. 

Dyslexia is the most widespread specific learning difference, making the acquiring and using of reading, spelling and writing skills and other communication-related cultural abilities difficult (commonly known as 'DYS-differences'). 

Quoting academic surveys, other learning differences as dysphasia, dyscalculia, dyspraxia and attention deficit disorder exist commonly with dyslexia; known as 'DYS-differences', 
(concluded under 'DYS'). A same person can also accumulate some of these differences, dyslexia being associated to dysphasia, dyspraxia, dyscalculia or attention deficit.

It is generally known and documented that the cultural abilities of reading and writing are among the most important prerequisites in our society for individual cultural,
social and economic development and success. Furthermore, across Europe, the diversity of languages and the multilingual demands, socio-cultural backgrounds as well as educational opportunity,
have a significant influence on the manifestation of difficulties and life-chances for children, adolescents and adults with DYS differences.

### Is help or support necessary for dyslexics?

From [European Dyslexia Association](http://www.eda-info.eu)

Despite intelligence and motivation, without appropriate support, children who are dyslexic do not learn as their peers do. However, when diagnosed early, they can be helped to learn with specialist teaching that is success orientated,
structured and systematic. They will always require a great deal of support and encouragement.

"Dyslexia" tends to be the term preferred by parents and individuals experiencing the condition. There are many reasons for this including the fact that they do not accept that they are disabled in the true sense of 
the word, but rather that they learn in a different way that is often not catered for in traditional schooling.

[...]

Dyslexia is not synonymous with the terms like 'specific reading difficulty' or 'specific reading disability' or 'specific reading retardation'. It is, however, sometimes referred to as a 'specific learning difficulty' (or 'Spld'). 

Dyslexia does not affect inherent intelligence but its symptoms can often hide a greater intelligence than that exhibited when learning to read, write or spell. There is often exhibited a disparity between verbal and written ability.
In some countries 'Dyslexia' is used as a generic term to describe problems with reading, writing, spelling and number.
