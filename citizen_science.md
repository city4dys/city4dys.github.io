This document describes how the ten principles of Citizen Science are implemented in this project.

## 01

***Citizen science projects actively involve citizens in scientific research. Citizens can act as contributors, collaborators, or as project leader and have a meaningful role in the research project.***

All the stages of the projects will be carried out by citizens. There will be four roles into the team:

* Manager (states the objective of the project, acts as representative)
* Developer (implement the application, produces data)
* Expert in learning disorder (guides the implementation choices)
* End user (gives feedback in a continuous integration work flow)

Each role can receive feedback on hos work a has to be prone to change according to the feedback given, if reasonable.

There are no restrictions of any kind and a citizen can act multiple roles into the project, but to deliver an high quality service is mandatory at least for some end users to be:

* not developer, not manager and not experts in learning disorder
* dyslexic

## 02

***Citizen science projects have a genuine research question or goal.***

The project is the natural following of the experience "[OpenStreetMap for the dyslexic](http://www.osm4dys.org)" presented in Berlin at the [10th GEO European Projects Workshop 2016](https://ec.europa.eu/easme/en/geo-european-projects-workshop-2016).

At the city level there is no such application, making travelling quite cumbersome for a dyslexic person.

## 03

***Citizen scientists benefit from taking part. Benefits may include learning opportunities, social benefits, community cohesion, gathering evidence for a local issue, or the opportunity to influence policy.***

According to substantiated scientific estimates the group of European Citizens with dyslexia and specific learning differences encompasses between 5 and 12 percent of the population (Source: [European Dyslexia Association](http://www.eda-info.eu/dyslexia-in-europe) )

Boosting the way those people travel around the cities will turn into an enhancement on their quality of life and the community will raise the attention on their problems.

## 04

***Citizen scientists may, if they wish, participate in multiple stages of the scientific process. This may include developing the research question, designing the method, gathering and analysing data, and publishing the results.***

The former member of the team are experts in learning disorders or expert in Geographical Information Systems, and have developed the first and unique GIS application accessible ready for the dyslexics.

More citizen scientists can join the group and work together to deliver a better result or to increase the visibility. Communications will be carried out using GitHub, as an open group of open minded people.

## 05

***Citizen scientists receive feedback from the project. For example, how their data are being used and what the research, policy or societal outcomes are.***

The team will include at least one person with dyslexia. Dyslexics are the ideal candidates for end user, but can act as developers, publishers, managers, experts or designers too.

All the feedback given will be evaluated and used as input to enhance the application further, in a continuous integration work flow.

## 06

***Citizen science data are considered equally valuable as traditionally collected data.***

The only data collected from citizen will be the feedback on the application and is considered an indicator of the quality of the job done.

## 07

***Citizen science project data and meta-data are made publically available, and results are published in an open access format. Data sharing may occur during or after the project, unless there are security or privacy concerns that prevent this.***

All the data produced will be in open format, will consume open GTFS data and will produce maps and map services publicity available. Great attention will be put on the licences governing the access of the data.

## 08

***Citizen scientists are acknowledged in project results and publications.***

All the communication between the component of the team and between the team and the rest of the world are carried out using the GitHub platform.

Comments, suggestions, bugs and documents are publically available.

[One of the wiki pages of the project is for acknowledgements](/acknowledgements/), with the rules for mentioning this project.

## 09

***Citizen science programmes are evaluated for their scientific output, data quality, participant experience and wider societal or policy impact.***

The evaluation of the project, and the outputs will be evaluated by at least one member of the European Citizen Science Association.
Will be better to involve at least one working group chairman and more members.

## 10

***Citizen science is a flexible concept which can be adapted and applied within diverse situations and disciplines. Citizen science lends itself to cross-disciplinary work, bringing new perspectives and skills to a research project.***

This projects brings the methodologies we know that works in our every day activities from the field of the learning disorders into the field of the Geographical Information Systems with the focus on mobility.
