# At a glance

## What is the proposed application going to do?

* The primary objective is to help dyslexic to explore cities.
* The secondary objective is to raise awareness of the community on the dyslexia reading disorder.

## Advantages of this application

* Advantages for the city
    * An average of 8% of the population will explore the city in a more comfortable way [See EDA](http://www.eda-info.eu/dyslexia-in-europe) .
    * The city4dys logo (surrounded with a qrcode) can be used near city maps, is a quick link to the application
    * Not the application nor the city4dys platform will be used to promote private products through advertisements.
    * On the contrary there will be the possibility for the city to post messages about the travelling service or to inform the users about special events.
* Advantages for the user which is dyslexic  
    * Despite many applications where developed specifically for dyslexics, only one of them is spatially enabled, which is "OpenStreetMap for the dyslexic" made by the same people presenting here this project.
    * At the city level there is no such application, making travelling quite cumbersome for a dyslexic person.
